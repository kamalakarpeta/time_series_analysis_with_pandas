# Time Series Analysis with Pandas

This Jupyter Notebook provides a simplified example of how to perform time series analysis with pandas. The example uses the AirPassengers dataset, which is a built-in dataset in Python's seaborn library.

## Introduction
Time series analysis is a powerful technique used to analyze and forecast data that is collected over a period of time. In this example, we will demonstrate how to perform time series analysis using the pandas library in Python. We will load the AirPassengers dataset, visualize the data, implement a Moving Average model, and an ARIMA model.

## Dependencies
The following libraries are required for this analysis:
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- statsmodels
- sklearn

You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib statsmodels scikit-learn
## GitHub Repository
The code for this analysis can be found in the following GitHub repository: [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kamalakarpeta/time_series_analysis_with_pandas)

## Conclusion
In this example, we demonstrated how to perform time series analysis with pandas. We imported the necessary libraries, loaded the AirPassengers dataset, visualized the data, implemented a Moving Average model, and an ARIMA model.

However, it is important to note that time series analysis is a complex field, and this example only provides a basic overview. There are many more techniques and models available for time series analysis, and the choice of model depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the forecasting goals.

To gain a deeper understanding of time series analysis, it is recommended to explore additional resources and literature on the topic. This will help you learn about concepts like stationarity, seasonality, trend, model diagnostics, and more advanced models like SARIMA, VAR, or LSTM.

Additionally, it is crucial to preprocess and clean your data, handle missing values, and validate your models using techniques such as cross-validation and out-of-sample testing. Time series analysis requires careful consideration of these factors to ensure accurate and reliable results.

The provided code can serve as a starting point for your own time series analysis projects. You can modify and adapt the code to suit your specific data and analysis requirements. Experiment with different models, adjust parameters, and evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
